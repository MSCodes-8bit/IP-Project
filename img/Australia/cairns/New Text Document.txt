Although Cairns itself is quite an unattractive place, the rainforests that surround it and the beautiful turquoise waters that lap against its beaches more than make up for the lack of sights in the city. A popular tourist destination, the city is considered to be the gateway to the Great Barrier Reef; this is the primary reason why Cairns is so inundated with tourists. Away from the reef, there are loads of amazing natural sights nearby, and lots of people stop by Cairns on their way to visit Daintree National Park or the Wet Tropics of Queensland. The fourth most popular city to visit in Australia, Cairns has enough good bars, restaurants and shopping options to keep visitors entertained before they head off into the stunning nature nearby.
